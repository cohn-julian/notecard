# notecard
Python terminal program for making and studying notecards.

Saving is prompted after making a set or after editing a set.

To edit a card make a new card with the same term.

To save a set over another set use the same name when prompted

For use in a terminal. I am not sure if the "clear" command used to clear the terminal will work in an IDE or other python interpreters.
